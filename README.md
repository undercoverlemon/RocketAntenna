# RocketAntenna

This rocket antenna design is designed for telemtry communications on the 915 MHz LoRa band. It was designed for the RMIT HIVE rocket team for competition use.

Due to the use of a carbon-fibre shell (which is conductive at RF freuqnecies) in upcoming designs an external, flush-mounted antenna is required. To avoid needing significant thickening of the shell, a thin antenna is needed. To achieve this, and meet the antenna bandwidth requirements, an innovative *double-tuning* design has been used.

Check out the brochure and poster provided above for more details.
